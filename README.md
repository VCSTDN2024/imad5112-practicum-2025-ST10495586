Project Overview 

 

The Music Playlist is a mobile app developed as part of a practicum in the [IMAD5112] subject. This Android app is built using Kotlin and Android Studio. 

 

The primary purpose of the app is to allow users to rate songs and give a commment on the song. 

Purpose and Features 

 

Purpose 

 

The app allows users to enter song details and give a rating (1-5) of the song including entering the artists name and the song title 

Key Features 

• Playlist: Users create and manage playlists. 

• Next Button: A button to take the user to the second screen. 

• Exit Button: Allows users to close the application. 

• Input Validation: Ensures that only valid numeric input is accepted. 

 

Design Considerations 

1. User Experience (UX): Designed with a simple and intuitive interface for easy navigation. 

2. Responsiveness: Ensures compatibility with different screen sizes. 

3. Simplicity: Focused on core functionality without unnecessary complexity. 

4. Performance: Optimized for fast response times and efficient resource usage. 

 

GitHub and GitHub Actions Utilization 

 

This project uses GitHub for version control, enabling proper tracking of changes and maintaining project integrity. 

 

GitHub Actions 

 

GitHub Actions were implemented to: 

• Automate Testing: Run automated tests to check app functionality. 

• Build Automation: Generate APK and AAB files for distribution. 

• Continuous Integration: Ensure the app is automatically built and tested on every push.

Challenges and Learnings 

 

Challenges Faced 

1. App: App is refusing to run. 

• Emulator: The app including the emulator is not running. 

2. Exiting the Application Properly: Handling the exit function correctly. 

• Solution: Used finish() to close the app smoothly. 

 

Learnings 

• Improved Kotlin programming skills, particularly in UI handling and event-driven programming. 

• Learned the importance of proper input validation and error handling. 

• Gained experience in using GitHub Actions for CI/CD. 

 

Future Enhancements 

• User Preferences: Allow users to set preferred meal times. 

• Database Integration: Store and retrieve meal preferences. 

• Dark Mode: Add a dark mode option for better usability.
